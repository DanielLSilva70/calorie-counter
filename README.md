## Calorie Counter is a fullstack app I developed in the span of one week. The app allows you to input how many calories you would like to consume throughout the day. Once you do that the amount of calories you have input will display on the top of your screen. The app also allows you to input what you have consumed and how many calories it contains. Once you fill out those two requirements you can hit the add button, and it will display those items on the bottom of the screen also the amount of calories you sent in will be subtracted from your total amount of calories you have set before that.
